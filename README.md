# quick-demo-project
Is a simple Node.js REST API developed for a quick GitHub CI/CD demonstration with GitHub Actions usage.

## Why ?
Since hiring is not only a question of skills but of potential for the future. I hope this quick project will show my ability to learn a new techno depsite my lack of hands-on experience on GitHub Actions and Terraform and therefore, show (I hope) my potential in provide value for the GHOST company for the future.
